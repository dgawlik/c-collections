# C collections

C doesn't have generics... or does it? When you think about it one dirty hack comes to mind - preprocessor macros.

This library is a collection of pseudo-generic collections implemented as such macros. The usage is quite simple
and documented below. You can also go straight to the examples in ```examples``` folder or ```tests```.

It is pure header library - just copy from ```include``` folder collection that interests you.

## Usage

```bash
autoreconf --install
./configure
make
make check
```
