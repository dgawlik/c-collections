## Feature PRs

Project needs more collections:
  * HashSet
  * TreeSet
  * PriorityQueue
  * TreeHashmap
  * LinkedList

If you feel you have some spare time drop an PR.

The existing collections would also benefit from addirional methods:

HashMap:
  * getOrDefault
  * compute
  * iterator
  * values
  * clone

Vector:
  * allOf, noneOf, anyOf
  * slice
  * removeIf

... and many more.
